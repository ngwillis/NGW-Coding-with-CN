            <b>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</b>
            <br><br>This was my first website development project. I was working autonomously with remote tutor and peer support.
            <br><br>The greatest strength of my website is that it is my own creation with the support of my class and tutor.
            <br>Created at pace, in a boot camp atmosphere and to a strict deadline.
            <br><br>It's weakness is that it was managed without a full PM lifecycle.
            <br>More time should have been spent all aspects of the project.
            <br><br>This is desirable because the purposes of this project was to start me on the path of website development, to work independently and unsupported and to create deliverables under very tight timescales.
            <br>I am exceptionally proud of my final result because of the strengths and weaknesses I describe. I will always say that this project would not be the same without these constraints.
