        <b>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</b>

        <br><br>Just like Estates and Human Resources (HR), Information Technology (IT) can be considered as a central service in any organisation.
        <br><br>In a Pure Play <b>[4]</b> IT company, this can be the main activity that an organisation undertakes and can be used to describe companies of any size from large global to SMEs.

        <br><br>At the other extreme an individual working as a sole trader <b>[5]</b> may be dedicated exclusively to providing IT Services.
        <br>Family members, contractors or temporary staff me be providing accountancy and HR support for example.

        <br><br>Essentailly, the purpose of IT is to provide computer products or services.
        <br><br>These can range from computer, printer and communications hardware to a variety of software. Sometimes costs can be reduced when IT is provided as a “service”.
        <br>This means that you pay an annual fee on a regular basis and an external company will provide whatever you need.
        <br>This can include on-site/off-site maintenance, technical support via phone, email or website or training delivered in-person, virtually or via CBT
