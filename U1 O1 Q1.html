        <b>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</b>

        <br><br>Just like Estates and Human Resources (HR), Information Technology (IT) can be considered as a central service in any organisation. In a Pure Play <b>[1]</b> IT company, this can be the main activity that an organisation undertakes and can be used to describe companies of any size from large global to SMEs.

        <br><br>At the other extreme an individual working as a sole trader <B>[2]</b> may be dedicated exclusively to providing IT Services; Possibly with family members, Contractors or temporary staff providing Accountancy, HR services support for example.

        <br><br>The purpose of IT is to provide computer products or services. These can range from computer, printer and communications hardware, software. Sometimes costs can be reduced when IT is provided as a “service”. Basically this means that you pay an annual fee on a regular basis. An external company will provide whatever you need. This can include on-site/off-site maintenance, Technical support via phone, email or website or Training delivered in-person, virtually or by C.B.T
