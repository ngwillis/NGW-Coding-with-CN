        <b>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</b>

        <br><br>Copyrighting, GDPR and Plagiarism are the main constraints that impact digital projects
        <br><br>The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, is the current UK copyright law. It gives the creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works the right to control the ways in which their material may be used. The rights cover: Broadcast and public performance, copying, adapting, issuing, renting and lending copies to the public. As described by the UK Copyright Service <B>[6]</B>
        <br><br>According to the University of Oxford, “Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work or ideas as your own, with or without their consent, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement.” <B>[7]</B>
        <br><br>In essence, The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) is a new set of rules designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data. <B>[8]</B> .
        <br>The legislation is too complex to describe fully here but a good examples of GDPR in practice is when any European citizen uses a website regardless of where it is hosted.
        <br><br>For many websites to function they need to store cookies on your computer. These are used to perform analytics, tailoring and marketing functions.
