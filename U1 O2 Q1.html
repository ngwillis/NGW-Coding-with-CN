            <b> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</b>
            <br><br> My website will soon be ready for user testing. I need to review the tools in use.

            <br><br> Trello is a very simple tool that allows me to maintain a visual representation of my project tasks. 
            <br> It was been insufficient for my website project because it lacks the ability to order tasks within milestones.

            <br><br>This project requires me to:
            <br> 1. Research information, methods and tools
            <br> 2. Undergo training in HTML, CSS and others.
            <br> 3. Carry out proof of concept
            <br> 4. Undertake exhaustive planning to ensure all deliverables are realized.
            <br> 5. Carry out extensive developer testing.
            <br> 6. Arrange for user testing.
            <br> 7. Publish my website - go live.
