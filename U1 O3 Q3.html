            <b>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</b>
            <br><br>One solution is the mantra "one thing at a time".
            <br><br>During work periods i would mute slack and restrict use to breaks. Would also restrict work time for work activities.
            <br><br>I would stick to a 7.5 hour day with an mandatory 60 minute lunch break, fifteen minute breaks mid morning and mid afternoon as well as five minute breaks every hour.
            <br><br>Reviewing my progress at least one a day would help me achieve daily and weekly targets.
            <br><br>I would also subscribe to a limit number of newsletters and forums to keep in touch with professional and technical developments in IT and technology.
