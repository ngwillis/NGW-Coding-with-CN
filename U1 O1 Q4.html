            <b>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</b>

            <br><br>Digital is now an outdated term originally used to describe the use of electronic or electrical equipment used to provide complete products and/or services. A digital watch is one example of a digital product. Just as the internet provides us with a myriad of services.

            <br><br>Digital project, depending on their complexity and scope may involve:
            <br><br>Hardware - clients, servers, mobile devices,
            <br><br>Services - World Wide Web [3]
            <br><br>Infrastructure - TheInternet [3]
            
            <br><br>In today's terms, a simple digital project may involve creating a website with a few pages as a way to demonstrate my ability to communicate my ideas with anyone anywhere in the world.
            This might involve selecting a hosting provider who may provide a number of packages with add-ons as a service
            You can either use native tools to design web pages with text and images or specialist software packages.
