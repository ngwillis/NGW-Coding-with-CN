            <b>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</b>
            <br><br>The first and worst test is developer testing.
            <br>Paradoxically the developer is the best and worst tester because I know my own software but may get a little foggy with prolonged testing.
            <br><br>Peer reviewing is also invaluable but only be available free on rare occasions.
            <br>This may be the best way to deal with technical issues.
            <br><br>User testing as always is the best form in my opinion because they will be the regular users
            <br> They have needs that must be met by my website.
            <br>They can provide valuable feedback, Especially those that are disabled.
            <br><br>I plan to include a feedback page on my website so anyone could complain, offer feedback and report issues.
