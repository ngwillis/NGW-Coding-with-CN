            From the age of 10 , my main interest was Mathematics.
            <br><br>After finishing school, I went on to complete a Higher National Diploma (H.N.D) course in Mathematics, Statistics and Computing. 
            <br>That was when I developed a taste for programming with FORTRAN, COBOL and BASIC.
            <br><br>I spent 15 years working as an IT Specialist in Manufacturing.
            <br>Creating programs in FORTRAN with a specialization in Numeric Control Systems. 
            <br><br>Next I spent another 15 years working in IT Services, supporting Web and Client based applications in a broad range of companies.
            <br>In areas such as Defense, Aerospace and Manufacturing.
            <br>At the same time I was developing my interest in JavaScript.
            <br><br>After spending 3 years trying to discover myself, I decided it was time to improve my skills. 
            <br>I spent time studying GCSE English Language at my local College and SQL using computer based training.
            <br>I finally decided that my interest lay in developing Client, Website and mobile applications.
            <br><br>Eventually codenation drew my attention as a great place to find out what skills are most employable.
            <br>I decided that Python, HTML and CSS were to be my next step forward.
