            <b>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</b>
            <br><br>The biggest drawback of my chosen IT Tools was the learning curve needed to become a competent user.
            <br>Visual Studio Code (VSC), Trello and GitHub were all new to me. 
            <br><br>Completing this project at pace meant that I was not able to undertake structured training and so may have failed to capitalise on some functionality. 
            <br><br>Using due dates on my Trello board as well as Run (debugging & breakpoint) and View (word wrap) functionality in VSC from the outset.
            <br>The benefits of both these tools are that they are simple to use with basic functionality meant that i could successfully complete simple website functionality with little difficulty. 
            <br>Some drawbacks were mitigated because I was also lucky to receive first class support from my instructor in using all of these tools.
