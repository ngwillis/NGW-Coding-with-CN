            <b>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</b>
            
            <br><br>Projects are always completed by teams of at least one person. A small project may contain only one person with many skills and roles. But for ‘big’ projects there can be many permanent, temporary or contracted members depending on the needs of the project.
            <br><br>The most important role is that of the stakeholder. This is the person(s) to whom the project will deliver products/services. They have the final say on the project and will agree the details and terms of the project with the project manager. This can include the project milestones broken down into a set of activities.
            <br><br>The next important role is the project manager. Responsible for ‘hiring and firing’ team members as required by the project plan.
            <br><br>Key roles/skills on a project will be finance, communications and resourcing. Many roles will be handled by the project manager. Who may delegate some to other project team members.
            <br><br>The resources needed to complete Digital projects can be a variety of hardware, software and services. Many projects will re-use existing hardware if it is compatible.
            <br><br>Many software resources are free or Open Source and are available for projects that do not have complex needs. The most common resources are web based such as project management (Trello) and documentation (draw.io, Google Docs, OneDrive, OpenOffice).
            <br><br>Basic Skills such as computer and printer operation are very common and can sometimes be acquired at little or no cost.
            <br><br>Methods such as installing, maintaining and operating computer software are also widely available thanks to their everyday use.
