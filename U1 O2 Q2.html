            <b>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</b>
            <br><br>I selected Trello, Visual Studio Code and two popular browsers (Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome).
            <br>Trello was used for project management because it gave a simple visual representation of the tasks in a To Do, Doing and Done layout.
            <br>Due to the sheer volume of tasks , my project would have benefitted from milestones.
            <br>For my next project i will look at ways to incorporate them in Trello or look for alternative cost effective solutions.

            <br><br>Visual Studio Code was an excellent development tool because it allowed me to edit multiple files simultaneously.
            <br>It has the capability to install addons with 'one click' and display all of my programming files in the navigating frame.

            <br><br>Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome were used to test my website.
            <br>Saurabh K describes in an article on the technumero website what the most popular browsers were in 2019 <b>[9]</b>.
            <br>I may need to test in other popular browsers for compatibility
