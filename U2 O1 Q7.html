            <b>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</b>
            <br><br>The two most common filetypes for websites are HTML and CSS.
            <br><br>For images this will be JPG,BMP and PNG. Other formats such as TIFF are not expected to be compatible.
            <br>Generally images will need to be displayed in a variety of densities and will need rigorous testing.            
            <br><br>Audio/visual files can be mp3 and mp4 as well as many many others!
            <br>I will need to decide how these will be handled by my website.
            <br>Either embedded players or licensed 3rd party apps on the users own computer.
