            <b>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</b>
            <br><br>My productivity and efficiency would improve with training in time management, project management, systems analysis & design and additional training in my chosen toolset.
            <br><br>Access to online communities like GitHub, Javascript.info  reddit and those supporting my chosen tools by increased my technical knowledge.
            <br><br>Working in a boot camp is a good way to learn technical skills.
            <br>After three weeks my productivity is starting to decline because this environment not only makes it acceptable but encourages working long hours.
            <br>In the long term it will be better for my mental health if i worked a standard 7,5 hkurs with short hourly breaks.
            <br><br>Regular project reviews would be beneficial to make sure my projects remain on track in terms of time, budget and quality.
