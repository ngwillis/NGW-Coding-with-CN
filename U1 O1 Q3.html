        <b>Plan and carry out tasks using IT.</b>
        <br><br>The ultimate planning tool is Trello Boards. Using the Kanban technique of To Do, Doing and Done. Each individual task is created on an electronic card with details of the task such as due date and who is doing the task. Cards generally move from "To Do" , then "Doing" then "Done" but other steps can be included such as Delayed or Future Enhancement for example. The system is simplicity itself and a pleasure to use.
        <br><br>Online Services such as Google Drive are excellent resources for storing,collaborating and keeping project documents using Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.
        <br><br>Zoom and Google Hangouts are essential resources that allow my project team to collaborate and communicate in real time. Meetings can be planned with specific team members ad hoc for brainstorming or one-to-ones.
